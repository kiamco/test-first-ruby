These are my solutions to the testfirst.org [Learn Ruby](http://testfirst.org/learn_ruby) sequence. These exercises involve cloning their [github repo](https://github.com/alexch/learn_ruby) and writing the code to solve the given tests.

Some of the more interesting problems involved:
 * writing an XML generator
 * writing a performance monitor
 * writing a reverse polish notation calculator
 * writing an extension to Fixnum to print numbers in English.

I'll probably be refactoring some of these solutions in the coming days or weeks.
